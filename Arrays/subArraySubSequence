Sub Array is a continuous part of an array.
1 2 0 7 2 0 2      =  Array A
  |     |
  |     |  
  2 0 7 2
This is a Sub Array of the A.
Total subarray in an Array are = nC2 + n 
                               = n*(n+1)/2


Sub Sequence is a Sequence that can be derived from an array by selecting
ZERO or MORE elements, wihtout changing the order of the remaining elements.

1  2  0  7  2  0  2     = Array B
  | |   |    | 
  | |   |    |
   2     7  2 

This is a sub sequence of array B.
Total sub sequence in an array are = 2^nC2


NOTE - Every subArray is a subSequence but the Vice Versa is not true.
